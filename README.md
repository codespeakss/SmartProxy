# SmartProxy
SmartProxy is a lightweight and intelligent HTTP/HTTPS proxy server built with Go.  
It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, including:

- Domain blacklist to block unwanted hosts
- Per-domain request limits and traffic quotas
- Smart routing (direct, upstream proxy, or block)
- Detailed logging and traffic statistics

This makes it suitable for controlled environments, auditing, or bandwidth management scenarios.
